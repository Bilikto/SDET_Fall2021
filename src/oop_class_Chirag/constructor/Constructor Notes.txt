Constructor 

1. Special method inside the which has same name as class name
2. It can have access modifier - public, private, protected, default 
3. It must not have return type
4. It'll get called automatically when we create an object of class
5. Constructor cannot be static
6. Purpose - It helps to initialize object variabls 
7. When we don't have any constructor in the class, java will add
default contructor but as soon as you'll add your own constructor in the 
class java will remove / not add default constructor

// Syntax Of Constructor
ClassName(optional arguments){

}


Types of Constructor 

1. Default Constructor - If we don't specify / write constructor inside the 
class java will add default (hidden) constructor in the class which has below syntax

public ClassName(){

}

2. No Arg Constructor - Explicit constructor added by developer. We can write any statements inside
explicit constructor

3. Parameterized - Explicit constructor added by developer which take parameter from user that means
when we create an object of class we've to pass parameters to the constructor
