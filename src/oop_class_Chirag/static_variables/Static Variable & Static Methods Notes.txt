Static Variables
	* It belongs to the class (it's class property) and not object 
	* It'll create single copy at class level regardless of how many objects we're creating from class Example - FamilyIncome
	* We can directly access static variable using class name 


Static Method 
	* We don't required object to access static methods and we can directly use class name to acccess static members(variable + methods)
	* From static methods we can only call / use static members only

*** Instance variable will get created in the memory when we create an object of the class 
*** We don't required to create an object to call the static methods
