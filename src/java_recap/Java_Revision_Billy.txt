ABOUT JAVA:
- What is Java?
    Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
    Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.
    James Gosling is known as the father of Java.

 A list of important features of Java:
    - Simple language;
    - Object-oriented programming language --> all are objects in Java (class, object + 4 principles);
    - Platform independent (write once, run anywhere ("platform" is hardware and software environment));
    - Secured --> we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox.
    - Robust (strong) --> Java uses strong memory management. Garbage collection is implemented.

 There are 4 editions of Java:
    1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)
       It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc.
       It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.
    2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
       It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform.
       It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.
    3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)
       It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications.
    4) JavaFX
       It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.


BASICS OF JAVA:
- Compilation Flow:
    javac (HelloWorld.java (Java Code))   -->   Compiler  --> java (HelloWorld.class (Byte Code))

- JDK, JRE and JVM:
    "JVM" (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a
    runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.
    "JRE" (Java Runtime Environment). The JRE is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment.
    It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
    "JDK" (Java Development Kit). The JDK is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications.
    It physically exists. It contains JRE, JVM + development tools (javac, java etc).


VARIABLES:
    A "variable" is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.
    A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.
    - "Local": Variable created inside any blocks (for loop, methods, if condition), or not declared at class level are the local variables
               Local variable can be accessible only inside the blocks where it is created
               Local variable can not be static & can not be private, public
               Local variable must be initialized before use
               Local variable can be final
    - "Instance": Variable created at class level without static keyword are the instance variables
                  It belongs to the objects
                  Instance variable initialized by default (default value for int - 0 & String - null)
                  Instance variable can be private, public
                  Instance variable can be final
                  Instance variable will have multiple copies with respect to number of object we're creating from class
    - "Static": Variable created at class level with static keyword are the Static variables
                It belongs to the class
                Static variable initialized by default (default value for int - 0 & String - null)
                Static variable can be private, public
                Static variable will have single copy at class level regardless of number of object we're creating from class
                Static variable can be final


DATA TYPES:
"Primitive" (8 data types)
byte, short, int, long, double, float, boolean, char.

"Non-Primitive" (reference types)
Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.


OPERATORS:
There are many types of operators in Java:
"Unary" Operator --> postfix (expr++, expr--)
                 --> prefix (++expr, --expr)
"Arithmetic" Operator --> multiplicative (*, /, %)
                      --> additive (+, -)
"Shift" --> shift (<<, >>, >>>)
"Relational" --> comparison (<, >, <=, >=, instanceof)
             --> equality (==, !=)
"Bitwise" --> AND (&)
          --> exclusive OR (^)
          --> inclusive OR (|)
"Logical" --> AND (&&)
          --> OR (||)
"Ternary" --> ternary (? :)
"Assignment" --> (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, |=, <<=, >>=, >>>=)


DATA TYPE CASTING:
data type casting --> is converting one data type to another.
- "Implicit" [automatically] -> it happens automatically when we convert from smaller to larger data type;
- "Explicit" [manually] -> when we convert from larger to smaller data type, because we might loose some value in our data
    EX: Explicit type casting - from double to int
        double d1 = 12.34;
        int i = d1 -> incompatible types compile error and in order to fix this we need to manually type cast it as follows
        int i = (int) d1;


AUTOBOXING and UNBOXING:
"Autoboxing" is converting primitive to wrapper class objects;
"Unboxing" is converting from wrapper object to primitive.


CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS:
Java provides 3 types of control flow statements:
1. Decision Making statements (conditional statements)
    - if, if-else statements
    - switch statements
2. Loop statements
    - do_while loop
    - while loop
    - for loop
    - for_each loop
3. Jump statements
    - break statement
    - continue statement

"Decision Making statements" decide which statement to execute and when. It evaluates condition to Boolean expression.
Ex: if(true) {...}
"Switch" statement supports --> byte, short, int, char, Byte, Short, Integer, Character, String and enumeration.
It doesn`t support --> double, float, boolean.
The case value must be literal or constant! It doesn't allow variables.
Ex: switch(expr) {
        case value1: // --> value1 must be final value! it can not be expression!
            statement1;
            break;
        .
        .
        case valueN:
            statementN;
            break;
        default:
            default statement;
}

"Loop statements" are used to execute the set of instructions in a repeated order.
"for loop": ---> for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {..}
We use the "for loop" only when we exactly know the number of times, we want to execute the block of code.

"for-each loop": ---> for(data_type var: array/collection) {...}
Java provides an enhanced for loop to traverse the data structures like array or collection. In the for-each loop, we don't need to update the loop variable.

"while loop" ---> while(condition) {...}
If we don't know the number of iterations in advance, it is recommended to use a "while" loop

"do_while loop" ---> do { statements } while(condition)
When the number of iteration is not known and we have to execute the loop at least once, we can use do-while loop.

"Jump statements" are used to transfer the execution control to the other part of the program.
"break" is used to break the current flow of the program and transfer the control to the next statement outside a loop or switch statement.
However, it breaks only the inner loop in the case of the nested loop. The break statement cannot be used independently, it can only be written inside the loop or switch statement.
"continue" doesn't break the loop, it skips the specific part of the loop and jumps to the next iteration of the loop immediately.

OOP CONCEPTS
 -Object
 -Class
 -Method
 -Constructor
 -Static keyword
 -Types of Variables(Local, Static, Instance)
 -Inheritance
 -Polymorphism
 -Abstraction
 -Encapsulation
There are some other terms which are used in OOP:
 -Coupling (when a class has the details information of another class, it arises when classes are aware of each other)
 -Cohesion (It refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task)
 -Association (It represents the relationship between the objects)
 -Aggregation (It represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. It is also termed as a HAS-A relationship in Java)
 -Composition (The composition represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state.  There is a strong relationship between the containing object and the dependent object.
               If you delete the parent object, all the child objects will be deleted automatically)

Object
Objects is any entity that has state abd behaviour (Ex: a chair, pen, table, dog, cat). It is an instance of a class.

Class
Class is collection of objects. It is a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.

Inheritance --> when one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent object
	-extends keyword
	-Constructor Chaining
	-"this" keyword
	-"super" keyword

Polymorphism
	-Method Overloading
	-Method Overriding
	-Dynamic Polymorphism / Run Time Polymorphism

Encapsulation
    -Access modifier
    -Getters & Setters

Abstraction
    -Abstract Class
    -Interface

Exception Handling
    -try_catch_finally

Generics
    -<T>

OOP vs PROCEDURE-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
1. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whareas, in a POP it is not easy to mange if code grows as project size increase.
2. OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere
3. OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the OOP language.

NAMING CONVENTION
Start with the uppercase letter:
Class --> It should be a noun such as Color, Button, System, Thread, etc.
Interface --> It should be an adjective such as Runnable, Remote, ActionListener.
Start with lowercase letter:
Method --> It should be a verb such as main(), print(), println().
Variable --> It should not start with the special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), _ (underscore).

Package --> It should be a lowercase letter such as java, lang. Multiple words are separated by dots (.) such as java.util.
Constant --> It should be in uppercase letters such as RED, YELLOW. Multiple words are separated an underscore(_) such as MAX_PRIORITY.
 +  camelCase!

OBJECTS
Object is any entity that has state and behavior. Ex: chair, pen, table etc.
An object is an instance of a class.
"State" --> represents the data(value) of an object
"Behavior" --> represents the behaviour(functionality) of an object
"Identity" --> every object has a a unique ID which is used by JVM to identity each object.

CLASS
It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
Class contains:
-Fields
-Methods
-Constructors
-Blocks
-Nested class and interface

Instance variable
- a variable which is created inside the class but outside the method, at class level
- It doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is created
- It belongs to the objects
- Instance variable initialized by default (default value for int - 0 & String - null)
- Instance variable can be private, public
- Instance variable can be final
- Instance variable will have multiple copies with respect to number of object we're creating from class

Method
In Java, a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object
Advantage of Method
-Code Reusability
-Code Optimization

Revision class with Chirag!

We can not override static methods it belongs to class!
Ex: Parent p = new Child();
    p.method(); // --> if we the method is overriden parent object "p" will call "static" method of parent class

We can not override variables! // --> parent object will call variable of parent class!

If Constructor is "private" we can not instantiate class.. we will get compilation error!

We can not use static methods and vars inside methods. Only at Class level.

We can not call from static methods non - static method and variables.
