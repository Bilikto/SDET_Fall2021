ABOUT JAVA:
- What is Java?
    Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
    Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.
    James Gosling is known as the father of Java.

 A list of important features of Java:
    - Simple language;
    - Object-oriented programming language --> all are objects in Java (class, object + 4 principles);
    - Platform independent (write once, run anywhere ("platform" is hardware and software environment));
    - Secured --> we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox.
    - Robust (strong) --> Java uses strong memory management. Garbage collection is implemented.

 There are 4 editions of Java:
    1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)
       It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc.
       It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.
    2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
       It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform.
       It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.
    3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)
       It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications.
    4) JavaFX
       It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.


BASICS OF JAVA:
- Compilation Flow:
    javac (HelloWorld.java (Java Code))   -->   Compiler  --> java (HelloWorld.class (Byte Code))

- JDK, JRE and JVM:
    "JVM" (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a
    runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.
    "JRE" (Java Runtime Environment). The JRE is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment.
    It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
    "JDK" (Java Development Kit). The JDK is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications.
    It physically exists. It contains JRE, JVM + development tools (javac, java etc).


VARIABLES:
    A "variable" is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.
    A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.
    - "Local": Variable created inside any blocks (for loop, methods, if condition), or not declared at class level are the local variables
               Local variable can be accessible only inside the blocks where it is created
               Local variable can not be static & can not be private, public
               Local variable must be initialized before use
               Local variable can be final
    - "Instance": Variable created at class level without static keyword are the instance variables
                  It belongs to the objects
                  Instance variable initialized by default (default value for int - 0 & String - null)
                  Instance variable can be private, public
                  Instance variable can be final
                  Instance variable will have multiple copies with respect to number of object we're creating from class
    - "Static": Variable created at class level with static keyword are the Static variables
                It belongs to the class
                Static variable initialized by default (default value for int - 0 & String - null)
                Static variable can be private, public
                Static variable will have single copy at class level regardless of number of object we're creating from class
                Static variable can be final


DATA TYPES:
"Primitive" (8 data types)
byte, short, int, long, double, float, boolean, char.

"Non-Primitive" (reference types)
Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.


OPERATORS:
There are many types of operators in Java:
"Unary" Operator --> postfix (expr++, expr--)
                 --> prefix (++expr, --expr)
"Arithmetic" Operator --> multiplicative (*, /, %)
                      --> additive (+, -)
"Shift" --> shift (<<, >>, >>>)
"Relational" --> comparison (<, >, <=, >=, instanceof)
             --> equality (==, !=)
"Bitwise" --> AND (&)
          --> exclusive OR (^)
          --> inclusive OR (|)
"Logical" --> AND (&&)
          --> OR (||)
"Ternary" --> ternary (? :)
"Assignment" --> (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, |=, <<=, >>=, >>>=)


DATA TYPE CASTING:
data type casting --> is converting one data type to another.
- "Implicit" [automatically] -> it happens automatically when we convert from smaller to larger data type;
- "Explicit" [manually] -> when we convert from larger to smaller data type, because we might loose some value in our data
    EX: Explicit type casting - from double to int
        double d1 = 12.34;
        int i = d1 -> incompatible types compile error and in order to fix this we need to manually type cast it as follows
        int i = (int) d1;


AUTOBOXING and UNBOXING:
"Autoboxing" is converting primitive to wrapper class objects;
"Unboxing" is converting from wrapper object to primitive.


CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS:
Java provides 3 types of control flow statements:
1. Decision Making statements
    - if, if-else statements
    - switch statements
2. Loop statements
    - do_while loop
    - while loop
    - for loop
    - for_each loop
3. Jump statements
    - break statement
    - continue statement

"Decision Making statements" --> decide which statement to execute and when. It evaluates condition to Boolean expression. Ex: if(true) {...}
