ABOUT JAVA:
- What is Java?
    Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
    Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.
    James Gosling is known as the father of Java.

 A list of important features of Java:
    - Simple language;
    - Object-oriented programming language --> all are objects in Java (class, object + 4 principles);
    - Platform independent (write once, run anywhere ("platform" is hardware and software environment));
    - Secured --> we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox.
    - Robust (strong) --> Java uses strong memory management. Garbage collection is implemented.

 There are 4 editions of Java:
    1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)
       It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc.
       It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.
    2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
       It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform.
       It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.
    3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)
       It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications.
    4) JavaFX
       It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.


BASICS OF JAVA:
- Compilation Flow:
    javac (HelloWorld.java (Java Code))   -->   Compiler  --> java (HelloWorld.class (Byte Code))

- JDK, JRE and JVM:
    "JVM" (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a
    runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.
    "JRE" (Java Runtime Environment). The JRE is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment.
    It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
    "JDK" (Java Development Kit). The JDK is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications.
    It physically exists. It contains JRE, JVM + development tools (javac, java etc).

- VARIABLES:
    A "variable" is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.
    A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.
    - local:
    - Instance:
    - Static:
- DATA TYPES:
